Documentation (and detailed install instructions) can be found 
online: http://reductivelabs.com/projects/puppet/documentation/

This is what you need to get puppet running:
-- Check you have Ruby version 1.8.2 or later
    You can download it from 
    ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/ruby-1.8.2.tar.gz
    Un tar it, then: ./configure; make; make install

-- http://reductivelabs.com/downloads/facter/facter-1.0.tgz
    A library that puppet needs to run.  Un tar it, and calling
    'ruby install.rb' file should successfully install it; let 
    me know if it doesn't.  Otherwise, you can just set RUBYLIB
    to contain its lib directory.

-- Install puppet
   Run 'ruby install.rb' or add the 'lib/' directory to your RUBYLIB path.

-- After that, you should be able to go into test/ and run ./test, 
   or run 'bin/puppet' on whichever puppet config files you want.
