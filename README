Introduction
============
There are currently three main components to Blink:

Objects
-------
These are the "primitives" of the language.  If you want to affect the system,
these are the only way to do it.  Their base class is in blink/objects.rb, and
they all inherit directly from that class.

Attributes
----------
Each of the Objects are basically a collection of attributes.  The attributes
themselves are how the system is actually modified -- e.g., you set
'file("/etc/passwd").owner = X', which modifies an attribute value, and that
results in the system itelf being modified.

Each attribute derives from blink/attribute.rb, but most attributes are actually
defined in the same file as the class that uses them (e.g., blink/objects/file.rb).

The Wrapper
-----------
At the top level is the Blink module.  It doesn't do much right now

Starting
========
You can start with bin/blinker, but it's probably better to just start in test/.
I've been writing simple unit tests for most of the work I've done, so you can
see how things do (and should) work by looking in there.  Just run 'ruby
<testfile>'.
