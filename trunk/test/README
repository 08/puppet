Tests are organized into a dual hierarchy: each subdirectory is
considered a test suite, and each file in the subdirectory is considered
a test case.  You can use any test case as an example of how to write
more of them, but basically the only requirements are that they each have
their own class names, their names each match /tc_.+\.r/, and that they have
the following header:

if __FILE__ == $0
    $:.unshift '..'
    $:.unshift '../../lib'
    $blinkbase = "../.."
end

To run all tests, just type './test'.  To run an individual suite, run
'./test <suite>'.  To run an individual case, cd into the suite
subdirectory and run './tc_<case>.rb'.  Tests are basically guaranteed
not to work without cd'ing into the subdirectory.
