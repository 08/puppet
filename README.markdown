Puppet Data CLI
===============
A set of executables that provide complete CLI access to Puppet's
core data types.  They also provide Interface classes for
each of the core data types, which are extensible via plugins.

For instance, you can create a new action for catalogs at
lib/puppet/interface/catalog/$action.rb.
