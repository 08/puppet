Autotest is a simple tool that automatically links tests with the files being
tested, and runs tests automatically when either the test or code has changed.

If you are running on a Mac and have growlnotify_ installed, install the
ZenTest_ gem, then copy the ``config`` file to ``~/.autotest`` (or just
run ``rake`` in this directory).
