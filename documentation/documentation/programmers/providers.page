# Providers

Since different systems often have ways of doing things, Puppet's uses a layer of abstraction called "providers" to provide a mechanism for implementing its types in system-specific ways.

For instance, on most UNIX systems, users and groups are added to the system simply by adding the new user or group to a flat file in the `/etc` directory.  However, other systems may use different mechanisms (such as NetInfo, LDAP, or Kerberos) either alone or in combination with flat files.

Currently, providers exist for groups, users, packages, nameservice, and system services using these mechanisms:

The following providers exist to add groups and users:
* `groupadd`/`useradd`
* NetInfo
* flat files

There are also providers for the following package management utilities:
* Apple Package Manager (pkg)
* `apt`
* `aptitude`
* `blastwave`
* `darwinport`
* Debian Package format (`dpkg`)
* FreeBSD Package format
* Ruby Gems
* OpenBSD Package format
* Portage
* Ports
* Redhat Package Manager (`rpm`)
* Sun
* Sunfreeware
* `up2date`
* `yum`

These providers can be used to add system services:
* base (basic service description)
* Standard SysV `init`
* debian-style SysV `init`
* redhat-style SysV `init` using `chkconfig`
* Sun Microsystem's "Service Management Framework" (`smf`)

If you create provider code for mechanisms not cited above, please consider contributing them to the project.
