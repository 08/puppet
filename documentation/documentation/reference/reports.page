Puppet clients can report back to the server after each
transaction.  This transaction report is sent as a YAML dump and includes every
log message that was generated during the transaction along with as many metrics
as Puppet knows how to collect.

Currently, clients default to not sending in reports; you can enable reporting
by setting the ``report`` parameter to true.

To use a report, set the ``reports`` parameter on the server; multiple
reports must be comma-separated.

Puppet provides multiple report handlers that will process client reports:

## rrdgraph

Graph all available data about hosts using the RRD library.  You
must have the RRD binary library installed to use this report, which
you can get from [Tobias Oetiker's site](http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/pub/contrib/).

This report will create, manage, and graph RRD database files for each
of the metrics generated during transactions, and it will create a
few simple html files to display the reporting host's graphs.  At this
point, it will not create a common index file to display links to
all hosts.

All RRD files and graphs get created in the ``rrddir`` directory.  If
you want to serve these publicly, you should be able to just alias that
directory in a web server.

## store

Store the yaml report on disk.  Each host sends its report as a YAML dump
and this just stores the file on disk, in the ``reportdir`` directory.

These files collect quickly -- one every half hour -- so it is a good idea
to perform some maintenance on them if you use this report (it's the only
default report).

## tagmail

This report sends specific log messages to specific email addresses
based on the tags in the log messages.  See the
[tag documentation](../advanced/tags.html) for more information on tags.

To use this report, you must create a ``tagmail.conf`` (in the location
specified by ``tagmap``).  This is a simple file that maps tags to
email addresses:  Any log messages in the report that match the specified
tags will be sent to the specified email addresses.

Tags must be comma-separated, and they can be negated so that messages
only match when they do not have that tag.  The tags are separated from
the email addresses by a colon, and the email addresses should also
be comma-separated.

Lastly, there is an ``all`` tag that will always match all log messages.

Here is an example tagmail.conf:

    all: me@domain.com
    webserver, !mailserver: httpadmins@domain.com

This will send all messages to ``me@domain.com``, and all messages from
webservers that are not also from mailservers to ``httpadmins@domain.com``.
