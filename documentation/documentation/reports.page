# Reports and Reporting

Puppet can be configured to run specialized reports to help you to better keep track of your configurations.

## Setting Up Reporting

Enabling and configuring reports must be handled both on the client and server as the client doesn't include reporting information unless explicitly requested. 

### Turn on reporting on the client-side.

In order to turn on reporting on the client-side (`puppetd`), the `report` argument must be given to the `puppetd` executable either by passing the argument to the executable on the command line, like this:

    $ puppetd --report

or by including the configuration parameter in the `puppetd` configuration file, usually located in `/etc/puppet/puppetd.conf`.  Take this `puppetd.conf` for instance,

    #
    #  /etc/puppetd.conf
    #
    [puppetd]
        report = true


With this setting enabled, the client will then send the data necessary for reporting to the puppetmasterd server at the appropriate times.
    
### Turn on reporting on the server-side

Next, the server must be configured to intepret the report results.  We'll tell it which reports to run by giving it a comma-separated list of reports we want to run against the client-submitted data.  Again, we can do this from the command line, like so:

    $ puppetmasterd --reports tagmail, daily, security

or we can include these configuration parameters in the configuration file, typically `/etc/puppet/puppetmasterd.conf`.  For example,

    #
    #  /etc/puppetmasterd.conf
    #
    [puppetmasterd]
        reports = tagmail, daily, security
    

You may also wish to specify the directory where reports will be stored with the  `[reportdirectory](configref.html#reportdirectory)` parameter.  Furthermore, transaction 
reports can optionally be sent to a special report server (not necessarily the server or 
client).  This server can be specified with the `[reportserver](configref.html#reportserver)`.

For more about configuring your server, take a look at the section on [Configuration Reference](configref.html).

## Available reports:

### tagmail

The `tagmail` report uses a "tagmap" mapping file to match certain reporting tags to certain e-mail recipients and sends messages with that tag to the appropriate recipients.  The wildcard tag `all` matches all transactions.

#### tagmap

The mapping between reporting tags and email addresses, typically `/etc/puppet/tagmail.conf`.

    #
    # /etc/puppet/tagmail.com - tagmail config
    #
    all:  root@localhost
	mail: postmaster@domain.com
	sun:  solarisadmins@domain.com
	

#### sendmail

Where to find the sendmail binary with which to send email.

#### reportfrom

The 'from' email address for the reports.
Default: report@hostname.domain.you

#### smtpserver

The server through which to send email reports.

### rrdgraph

The `rrdgraph` reports on the puppet system and its operations.  The reports are stored as HTML in the rrd directory, so puppet must have write access to this directory.

#### rrddir
The directory into which puppet will put the web-ready report files.  Of course, this directory will need to be puppet-writable.
