puppet (0.25.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  The default setting for puppet starting on boot has been changed from true
  to false.  This means the puppet client will not automatically start on
  install or boot until this file is modified.

  Note that the last Debian packaged version of puppet 0.24.x is too old to
  communicate with a 0.25.x puppetmaster server.  To resolve this, either
  upgrade your client to 0.25.x, or install puppet 0.24.8 from source from:
