  # Initially, this was defined to allow the @action.invoke pattern, which is
  # a very natural way to invoke behaviour given our introspection
  # capabilities.   Heck, our initial plan was to have the string delegate to
  # the action object for invocation and all.
  #
  # It turns out that we have a binding problem to solve: @string was bound to
  # the parent class, not the subclass instance, and we don't pass the
  # appropriate context or change the binding enough to make this work.
  #
  # We could hack around it, by either mandating that you pass the context in
  # to invoke, or try to get the binding right, but that has probably got
  # subtleties that we don't instantly think of â€“ especially around threads.
  #
  # So, we are pulling this method for now, and will return it to life when we
  # have the time to resolve the problem.  For now, you should replace...
  #
  #     @action = @string.get_action(name)
  #     @action.invoke(arg1, arg2, arg3)
  #
  # ...with...
  #
  #     @action = @string.get_action(name)
  #     @string.send(@action.name, arg1, arg2, arg3)
  #
  # I understand that is somewhat cumbersome, but it functions as desired.
