  # Initially, this was defined to allow the @action.invoke pattern, which is
  # a very natural way to invoke behaviour given our introspection
  # capabilities.   Heck, our initial plan was to have the faces delegate to
  # the action object for invocation and all.
  #
  # It turns out that we have a binding problem to solve: @face was bound to
  # the parent class, not the subclass instance, and we don't pass the
  # appropriate context or change the binding enough to make this work.
  #
  # We could hack around it, by either mandating that you pass the context in
  # to invoke, or try to get the binding right, but that has probably got
  # subtleties that we don't instantly think of â€“ especially around threads.
  #
  # So, we are pulling this method for now, and will return it to life when we
  # have the time to resolve the problem.  For now, you should replace...
  #
  #     @action = @face.get_action(name)
  #     @action.invoke(arg1, arg2, arg3)
  #
  # ...with...
  #
  #     @action = @face.get_action(name)
  #     @face.send(@action.name, arg1, arg2, arg3)
  #
  # I understand that is somewhat cumbersome, but it functions as desired.

    # We need to build an instance method as a wrapper, using normal code, to
    # be able to expose argument defaulting between the caller and definer in
    # the Ruby API.  An extra method is, sadly, required for Ruby 1.8 to work.
    #
    # In future this also gives us a place to hook in additional behaviour
    # such as calling out to the action instance to validate and coerce
    # parameters, which avoids any exciting context switching and all.
    #
    # Hopefully we can improve this when we finally shuffle off the last of
    # Ruby 1.8 support, but that looks to be a few "enterprise" release eras
    # away, so we are pretty stuck with this for now.
    #
    # Patches to make this work more nicely with Ruby 1.9 using runtime
    # version checking and all are welcome, but they can't actually help if
    # the results are not totally hidden away in here.
    #
    # Incidentally, we though about vendoring evil-ruby and actually adjusting
    # the internal C structure implementation details under the hood to make
    # this stuff work, because it would have been cleaner.  Which gives you an
    # idea how motivated we were to make this cleaner.  Sorry. --daniel 2011-03-31
