.SH DESCRIPTION
This command provides simple facilities for converting current system
state into Puppet code, along with some ability to use Puppet to affect
the current state.

By default, you must at least provide a type to list, which case ralsh
will tell you everything it knows about all instances of that type. You
can optionally specify an instance name, and ralsh will only describe
that single instance.

You can also add +\-\-edit+ as an argument, and ralsh will write its
output to a file, open that file in an editor, and then apply the file
as a Puppet transaction. You can easily use this to use Puppet to make
simple changes to a system.


.SH OPTIONS
Note that any configuration parameter that\'s valid in the configuration
file is also a valid long argument. For example, \'ssldir\' is a valid
configuration parameter, so you can specify \'\-\-ssldir <directory>\' as an
argument.

See the configuration file documentation at
\fI\%http://reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet/wiki/ConfigurationReference\fP for the
full list of acceptable parameters. A commented list of all
configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with
\'\-\-genconfig\'.

debug: Enable full debugging.
