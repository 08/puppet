.SH DESCRIPTION
This is the standalone puppet execution tool; use it to execute
individual manifests that you write. If you need to execute site\-wide
manifests, use +puppetd+ and +puppetmasterd+.


.SH OPTIONS
Note that any configuration parameter that\'s valid in the configuration
file is also a valid long argument. For example, \'ssldir\' is a valid
configuration parameter, so you can specify \'\-\-ssldir <directory>\' as an
argument.

See the configuration file documentation at
\fI\%http://reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet/wiki/ConfigurationReference\fP for the
full list of acceptable parameters. A commented list of all
configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with
\'\-\-genconfig\'.

debug:              Enable full debugging.

.TP
.B detailed\-exitcodes: Provide transaction information via exit codes. If
this is enabled, an exit code of \'2\' means there
were changes, and an exit code of \'4\' means that
there were failures during the transaction.

.UNINDENT
help:               Print this help message

.TP
.B loadclasses:        Load any stored classes. +puppetd+ caches configured
classes (usually at /etc/puppet/classes.txt), and
setting this option causes all of those classes to
be set in your +puppet+ manifest.


.TP
.B logdest:            Where to send messages. Choose between syslog, the
console, and a log file. Defaults to sending
messages to the console.

.UNINDENT
execute:            Execute a specific piece of Puppet code

verbose:            Print extra information.
