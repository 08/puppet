0.15.0
    Upped the minor release because the File server is incompatible with 0.14,
        because it now handles links.

    The 'symlink' type is deprecated (but still present), in favor of using
        files with the 'target' parameter.

    Unset variables no longer throw an error, they just return an empty string

    You can now specify tags to restrict which objects run during a given run.

    You can also specify to skip running against the cached copy when there's
    a failure, which is useful for testing new configurations.

    RPMs and Sun packages can now install, as long as they specify a package
        location, and they'll automatically upgrade if you point them to a new
        file with an upgrade.
    Multiple bug fixes.

    Fixed a couple of small logging bugs

    Many, many small bug fixes
    FreeBSD user/group support has been added
    The configuration system has been rewritten so that daemons can now generate

    Fixed bugs related to specifying arrays of requirements
    Fixed a key bug in retrieving checksums

        of the new features in puppetdoc, including many examples.

0.10.2
    Added SMF support
    Added autorequire functionality, with specific support for exec and file
        Exec elements autorequire any mentioned files, including the scripts,
        along with their CWDs.

    Added 'alias' metaparam.
