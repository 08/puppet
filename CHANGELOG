0.22.1 (kermit) -- Mostly a bugfix release
    Compile times now persist between restarts of puppetd.

    Timeouts have been added to many parts of Puppet, reducing the likelihood
    if it hanging forever on broken scripts or servers.

    All of the documentation and recipes have been moved to the wiki by Peter
    Abrahamsen and Ben Kite has moved the FAQ to the wiki.

    Explicit relationships now override automatic relationships, allowing you
    to manually specify deletion order when removing resources.

    Resources with dependencies can now be deleted as long as all of their
    dependencies are also being deleted.

    Namespaces for both classes and definitions now work much more consistently.
    You should now be able to specify a class or definition with a namespace
    everywhere you would normally expect to be able to specify one without.

    Downcasing of facts can be selectively disabled.

    Cyclic dependency graphs are now checked for and forbidden.

    The netinfo mounts provider was commented out, because it really doesn't
    work at all.  Stupid NetInfo stores mount information with the device as
    the key, which doesn't work with my current NetInfo code.

    Otherwise, lots and lots of bugfixes.  Check the tickets associated with the
    'kermit' milestone.

0.22.0
    Integrated the GRATR graph library into Puppet, for handling resource
    relationships.

    Lots of bug-fixes (see bugs tickets associated with the 'minor' milestone).

    Added new 'resources' metatype, which currently only includes the ability
    to purge unmanaged resources.

    Added better ability to generate new resource objects during transactions
    (using 'generate' and 'eval_generate' methods).

    Rewrote all Rails support with a much better database design.  Export/collect
    now works, although the database is incompatible with previous versions.

    Removed downcasing of facts and made most of the language case-insensitive.

    Added support for printing the graphs built during transactions.

    Reworked how paths are built for logging.

    Switched all providers to directly executing commands instead of going through
    a subshell, which removes the need to quote or escape arguments.

0.20.1
    Mostly a bug-fix release, with the most important fix being the
    multiple-definition error.

    Completely rewrote the ParsedFile system; each provider is now much
    shorter and much more maintainable.  However, fundamental problems
    were found with the 'port' type, so it was disabled.  Also, added
    a NetInfo provider for 'host' and an experimental NetInfo provider
    for 'mount'.

    Made the RRDGraph report *much* better and added reference
    generation for reports and functions.

0.20.0
    Significantly refactored the parser.  Resource overrides now consistently
    work anywhere in a class hierarchy.

    The language was also modified somewhat.  The previous export/collect syntax
    is now used for handling virtual objects, and export/collect (which is still
    experimental) now uses double sigils (@@ and <<| |>>).

    Resource references (e.g., File["/etc/passwd"]) now have to be capitalized,
    in fitting in with capitalizing type operations.

    As usual, lots of other smaller fixes, but most of the work was in the language.

0.19.3
    Fixing a bug in server/master.rb that causes the hostname
    not to be available in locally-executed manifests.

0.19.2
    Fixing a few smaller bugs, notably in the reports system.

    Refreshed objects now generate an event, which can result in further
    refreshes of other objects.

0.19.1
    Fixing two critical bugs:  User management works again and cron jobs are
    no longer added to all user accounts.

0.19.0
    Added provider support.

    Added support for %h, %H, and %d expansion in fileserver.conf.

    Added Certificate Revocation support.

    Made dynamic loading pervasive -- nearly every aspect of Puppet will now
    automatically load new instances (e.g., types, providers, and reports).

    Added support for automatic distribution of facts and plugins (custom types).

0.18.4
    Another bug-fix release.  The most import bug fixed is that
    cronjobs again work even with initially empty crontabs.

0.18.3
    Mostly a bug-fix release; fixed small bugs in the functionality added in
    0.18.2.

0.18.2
    Added templating support.

    Added reporting.

    Added gem and blastwave packaging support.

0.18.1
    Added signal handlers for HUP, so both client and server deal correctly with it.

    Added signal handler for USR1, which triggers a run on the client.

    As usual, fixed many bugs.

    Significant fixes to puppetrun -- it should behave much more correctly now.

    Added "fail" function which throws a syntax error if it's encountered.

    Added plugin downloading from the central server to the client.  It must be
    enabled with --pluginsync.

    Added support for FreeBSD's special "@daily" cron schedules.

    Correctly handling spaces in file sources.

    Moved documentation into svn tree.
    
0.18.0
    Added support for a "default" node.

    When multiple nodes are specified, they must now be comma-separated (this
    introduces a language incompatibility).

    Failed dependencies cause dependent objects within the same transaction
    not to run.

    Many updates to puppetrun

    Many bug fixes

    Function names are no longer reserved words.

    Links can now replace files.

0.17.2
    Added "puppetrun" application and associated runner server and client classes.

    Fixed cron support so it better supports valid values and environment settings.

0.17.1
    Fixing a bug requiring rails on all Debian boxes

    Fixing a couple of other small bugs

0.17.0
    Adding ActiveRecord integration on the server

    Adding export/collect functionality

    Fixing many bugs

0.16.5
    Fixing a critical bug in importing classes from other files

    Fixing nodename handling to actually allow dashes

0.16.4
    Fixing a critical bug in puppetd when acquiring a certificate for the first
    time

0.16.3
    Some significant bug fixes

    Modified puppetd so that it can now function as an agent independent
    of a puppetmasterd process, e.g., using the PuppetShow web application.

0.16.2
    Modified some of the AST classes so that class names, definition names, and
    node names are all set within the code being evaluated, so 'tagged(name)' returns
    true while evaluating 'name', for instance.

    Added '--clean' argument to puppetca to remove all traces of a given
    client.

0.16.1
    Added 'tagged' and 'defined' functions.

    Moved all functions to a general framework that makes it very easy to add new
    functions.

0.16.0
    Added 'tag' keyword/function.

    Added FreeBSD Ports support

    Added 'pelement' server for sending or receiving Puppet objects, although
    none of the executables use it yet.

0.15.3
    Fixed many bugs in :exec, including adding support for arrays of checks

    Added autoloading for types and service variants (e.g., you can now
    just create a new type in the appropriate location and use it in Puppet,
    without modifying the core Puppet libs).

0.15.2
    Added darwinport, Apple .pkg, and freebsd package types
    Added 'mount type
    Host facts are now set at the top scope (Bug #103)
    Added -e (inline exection) flag to 'puppet' executable
    Many small bug fixes

0.15.1
    Fixed 'yum' installs so that they successfully upgrade packages.
    Fixed puppetmasterd.conf file so group settings take.

0.15.0
    Upped the minor release because the File server is incompatible with 0.14,
        because it now handles links.

    The 'symlink' type is deprecated (but still present), in favor of using
        files with the 'target' parameter.

    Unset variables no longer throw an error, they just return an empty string

    You can now specify tags to restrict which objects run during a given run.

    You can also specify to skip running against the cached copy when there's
    a failure, which is useful for testing new configurations.

    RPMs and Sun packages can now install, as long as they specify a package
        location, and they'll automatically upgrade if you point them to a new
        file with an upgrade.
    Multiple bug fixes.

    The configuration system has been rewritten so that daemons can now generate
