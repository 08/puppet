    Many, many small bug fixes
    FreeBSD user/group support has been added
    The configuration system has been rewritten so that daemons can now generate
        and repair the files and directories they need. (Fixed bug #68.)

0.13.5
    Fixed packages so types can be specified
    Added 'enable' state to services, although it does not work everywhere yet

0.13.4
    A few important bug fixes, mostly in the parser.

0.13.3
    Changed transactions to be one-stage instead of two
    Changed all types to use self[:name] instead of self.name, to support
        the symbolic naming implemented in 0.13.1

0.13.2
    Changed package[answerfile] to package[adminfile], and added package[responsefile]
    Fixed a bunch of internal functions to behave more consistently and usefully

    Even more bug fixes, including the infamous 'frozen object' bug, which was a
        problem with 'waitforcert'.
    David Lutterkort got RPM into good shape.

0.12.0

    Fixed bugs related to specifying arrays of requirements
    Fixed a key bug in retrieving checksums

    Added OpenBSD package support.

0.11.0
    Added 'ensure' state to many elements.

        of the new features in puppetdoc, including many examples.

0.10.2
    Added SMF support
    Added autorequire functionality, with specific support for exec and file
        Exec elements autorequire any mentioned files, including the scripts,
        along with their CWDs.
        Files autorequire any parent directories.
    Added 'alias' metaparam.
    Fixed dependencies so they don't depend on file order.

0.10.1
    Added Solaris package support and changed puppetmasterd to run as
    a non-root user.

0.10.0
    Significant refactoring of how types, states, and parameters work, including
    breaking out parameters into a separate class.  This refactoring did not
    introduce much new functionality, but made extension of Puppet significantly
    easier
