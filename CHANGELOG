0.10.0
    Significant refactoring of how types, states, and parameters work, including
    breaking out parameters into a separate class.  This refactoring did not
    introduce much new functionality, but made extension of Puppet significantly
    easier

    Also, fixed the bug with 'waitforcert' in puppetd.
