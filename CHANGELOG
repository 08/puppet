        Exec elements autorequire any mentioned files, including the scripts,
        along with their CWDs.
        Files autorequire any parent directories.
    Added 'alias' metaparam.

    a non-root user.

0.10.0
    Significant refactoring of how types, states, and parameters work, including
    breaking out parameters into a separate class.  This refactoring did not
    introduce much new functionality, but made extension of Puppet significantly
