# = Usage
#
#   puppetdoc [-h|--help] [-m|--mode <typedocs|configref>
#
# = Description
#
# This command generates a restructured-text document describing all installed
# Puppet types or all allowable arguments to puppet executables.  It is largely
# meant for internal use and is used to generate the reference document
# available on the Reductive Labs web site.
#
# = Options
#
# help::
#   Print this help message
#
# mode::
#   Print documentation of a given type.  Valid optinos are 'typedocs', for
#   resource type documentation, and 'configref', for documentation on all
#   of the configuration parameters.
#
# trac::
#   Write the reference docs to trac.  Only works on servers at Reductive Labs.

==============================

Specifying Configuration Parameters
-----------------------------------

Every Puppet executable (with the exception of ``puppetdoc``) accepts all of
the arguments below, but not all of the arguments make sense for every executable.
Each argument has a section listed with it in parentheses; often, that section
will map to an executable (e.g., ``puppetd``), in which case it probably only
makes sense for that one executable.  If ``puppet`` is listed as the section,
it is most likely an option that is valid for everyone.

This will not always be the case.  I have tried to be as thorough as possible
in the descriptions of the arguments, so it should be obvious whether an
argument is appropriate or not.

These arguments can be supplied to the executables either as command-line 
arugments or in the configuration file for the appropriate executable.  For 
instance, the command-line invocation below would set the configuration directory
to ``/private/puppet``::
  
    $ puppetd --confdir=/private/puppet
  
Note that boolean options are turned on and off with a slightly different syntax
on the command line::

    $ puppetd --storeconfigs
      
    $ puppetd --no-storeconfigs

The invocations above will enable and disable, respectively, the storage of 
the client configuration.

As mentioned above, the configuration parameters can also be stored in a 
configuration file located in the configuration directory (`/etc/puppet` 
by default).  The file is named for the executable it is intended for, for
example `/etc/puppetd.conf` is the configuration file for `puppetd`.

The file, which follows INI-style formatting, should contain a bracketed
heading named for the executable, followed by pairs of parameters with their
values.  Here is an example of a very simple ``puppetd.conf`` file::

    [puppetd]
        confdir = /private/puppet
        storeconfigs = true
    
Note that boolean parameters must be explicitly specified as `true` or
`false` as seen above.

If you're starting out with a fresh configuration, you may wish to let
the executable generate a template configuration file for you by invoking
the executable in question with the `--genconfig` command.  The executable
will print a template configuration to standard output, which can be
redirected to a file like so::

    $ puppetd --genconfig > /etc/puppet/puppetd.conf
  
Note that this invocation will \"clobber\" (throw away) the contents of any
pre-existing `puppetd.conf` file, so make a backup of your present config
if it contains valuable information.
  
Like the `--genconfig` argument, the executables also accept a `--genmanifest`
argument, which will generate a manifest that can be used to manage all of 
Puppet's directories and files and prints it to standard output.  This can
likewise be redirected to a file::

    $ puppetd --genmanifest > /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp

Puppet can also create user and group accounts for itself (one `puppet` group
and one `puppet` user) if it is invoked as `root` with the `--mkusers` argument::

    $ puppetd --mkusers
  
Signals
-------

The `puppetd` and `puppetmasterd` executables catch some signals for special 
handling.  Both daemons catch (`SIGHUP`), which forces the server to restart 
tself.  Predictably, interrupt and terminate (`SIGINT` and `SIGHUP`) will shut 
down the server, whether it be an instance of `puppetd` or `puppetmasterd`.

Sending the `SIGUSR1` signal to an instance of `puppetd` will cause it to 
immediately begin a new configuration transaction with the server.  This 
signal has no effect on `puppetmasterd`.

Configuration Parameter Reference
---------------------------------

Below is a list of all documented parameters.  Any default values are in ``block type`` at the end of the description.

",
:reports => "Puppet clients can report back to the server after each transaction.  This
transaction report is sent as a YAML dump of the
``Puppet::Transaction::Report`` class and includes every log message that was
generated during the transaction along with as many metrics as Puppet knows how
to collect.  See `ReportsAndReporting Reports and Reporting`:trac:
for more information on how to use reports.

Currently, clients default to not sending in reports; you can enable reporting
by setting the ``report`` parameter to true.

To use a report, set the ``reports`` parameter on the server; multiple
reports must be comma-separated.  You can also specify ``none`` to disable
reports entirely.

Puppet provides multiple report handlers that will process client reports:

",
:functions => "There are two types of functions in Puppet: Statements and rvalues.
Statements stand on their own and do not return arguments; they are used for
performing stand-alone work like importing.  Rvalues return values and can
only be used in a statement requiring a value, such as an assignment or a case
statement. 

Here are the functions available in Puppet:

Metaparameters are parameters that work with any element; they are part of the
Puppet framework itself rather than being part of the implementation of any
given instance.  Thus, any defined metaparameter can be used with any instance
in your manifest, including defined components.

## Types

- *namevar* is the parameter used to uniquely identify a type instance.
  This is the parameter that gets assigned when a string is provided before
  the colon in a type declaration.  In general, only developers will need to
  worry about which parameter is the ``namevar``.
  
  In the following code:

      file { "/etc/passwd":
          owner => root,
          group => root,
          mode => 644
      }

  "/etc/passwd" is considered the name of the file object (used for things like
  dependency handling), and because ``path`` is the namevar for ``file``, that
  string is assigned to the ``path`` parameter.

- *parameters* determine the specific configuration of the instance.  They either
  directly modify the system (internally, these are called properties) or they affect
  how the instance behaves (e.g., adding a search path for ``exec`` instances
  or determining recursion on ``file`` instances).

- *providers* provide low-level functionality for a given resource type.  This is
  usually in the form of calling out to external commands.

  When required binaries are specified for providers, fully qualifed paths
  indicate that the binary must exist at that specific path and unqualified
  binaries indicate that Puppet will search for the binary using the shell
  path.

  Resource types define features they can use, and providers can be tested to see
  which features they provide.
